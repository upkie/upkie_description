import upkie_description

robot = upkie_description.load_in_pinocchio()
```

Check out the [Python README](dist/python/README.md) for more details.

## Joint limits

| Joint | Limit    | Value (Â±) | Unit | Why? |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|------|
| Hip   | Position | 0.2       | rev  | Cables fully stretched |
| Hip   | Velocity | 2         | rps  | Conservative, maximum rated velocity would be around 6 rps |
| Hip   | Torque   | 10        | Nm   | From the [qdd100 spec](https://mjbots.com/products/qdd100-beta-3) |
| Knee  | Position | 0.4       | rev  | Wheels touching hip actuators. |
| Knee  | Velocity | 2         | rps  | Conservative, maximum rated velocity would be around 6 rps |
| Knee  | Torque   | 10        | Nm   | From the [qdd100 spec](https://mjbots.com/products/qdd100-beta-3) |
| Wheel | Position | -         | -    | - |
| Wheel | Velocity | 8         | rps  | Conservative, maximum rated velocity [is 125 rps](https://mjbots.com/products/mj5208) |
